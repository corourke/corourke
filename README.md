Hi, I'm @corourke, [Cameron O'Rourke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronorourke/) in real life. With 35 years in the tech industry, including 23 years at Oracle, and 4 scrappy startups, I'm consulting, and having a blast with everything Web3. 

I mainly do product management and product development. This is about bringing order to chaos, articulating the product value proposition in a clear, compelling, and credible voice, and bringing products to market, from conception through development to launch.

In terms of coding, I'm constantly learning and try to write code whenever I can -- usually on weekends. Currently, I'm delving into the worlds of functional programming, and blockchain including smart contracts and DApps.
