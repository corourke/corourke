Hi, I'm @corourke, [Cameron O'Rourke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronorourke/) in real life. I'm currently employed at [Incorta](https://www.incorta.com/), as their Sr. Dir., Technical Product Marketing. 
Incorta makes an end-to-end data and analytics platform that is different from other analytics engines because it is capable of analyzing original, transaction-level business application data (3NF) without needing the usual data engineering to transform, aggregate, etc. into a dimensional model. 
This has positive implications for agility, flexibility and security. Check out the 6 or 7 '[Introducing Incorta](https://www.incorta.com/product-demo)' videos I made if interested.

I try to be constantly learning and I write code whenever possible, usually on weekends. I'm currently exploring: Typescript, React, Strapi, Next.JS, Airtable (as a data API), and others. 

I've been thinking about and working on a system for collecting, processing and organizing research. 
Something like https://glean.ly/ or https://consider.ly/ (I will love it when .ly has subsided) but more oriented towards general research. 
(Search for 'Atomic Research'.) 

You can reach me at cameron.orourke@incorta.com or cameron.orourke@gmail.com.
